		<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I am a Sophomore majoring in CS at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. 
			I love singing, dancing, and playing the piano. I also love taking Ballroom Dance 
			and Latin Dance classes at BYU.</p>
			<p>I come from Guangzhou, China. My parents spoke Mandarin with me growing up, but 
			I can also speak Cantonese because I grew up in Guangzhou, or Canton, which Cantonese
			was named after. </p>
			<p>I went to high school in central Indiana. Indiana is a great place and stored lots 
			of my great memories.</p>
			<p>I want to live in the Greater Seattle area after graduating from college. Here is a picture of 
			me with my good friend Celeste in downtown Seattle.</p>
